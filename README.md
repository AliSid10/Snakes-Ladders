# Snakes-Ladders

Hello!

This program gives the minimum number of fair six-sided throws required to win the game. (reach the 100th cell.)

How to run the code successfully.
	1. Download the pygame library.
	2. Download all the images and jpeg files in the repository on your computer and place all of them in a folder. Name it anything
	3. Download the code i.e Snakes&Ladders_project.py in the same folder.
	4. Now open this folder in the IDE you use like VSCode, Sublime, Pycharm, etc.
	5. Run the code.

Somethings to consider.

Read the input questions carefully.
You have to enter a 1 or 2-digit integer when asked.
Make sure that the base of the ladder is smaller than its head and top of the snake is greater than its base/bottom.
Make sure that the ladders and snakes are not at same positions.
